# AutoStamp
 Automatically stamp PDF files with Approval (My own project)

 My work requires me to stamp multiple files per week using Adobe Acrobat DC.
 
 My aim was to automate this by have all my PDFs in a single folder and bulk
 stamping in one go. The program works by having my approval stamp as it's own 
 separate PDF which then pastes as an overlay on my desired PDFs as a new PDF (intentional).

 - The Unstamped folder is where the original PDFs have been stored. 
 - The Approved folder is where the new PDFs are created.
 - AutoStamp.py to see the code
 - Stamp.pdf is the stamp used

 Future Improvements
    As the program pastes one PDF onto another the Approval stamp is always in
    the same location. I've tried to keep this out the way but on some documents
    this can overlay text. 
 
    Unable to do a Dynamic Stamp add Date & Time. This may have to be added 
    separately in Python.

Feedback Appreciated
